## What I need

Regular command fake run.

```bash
$ python manage.py importer
fake run
```

Scheduled command fake run.

```bash
$ python manage.py importer --scheduled
fake run
fake run
fake run
...etc...
```

Regular command real run.

```bash
$ python manage.py importer --real-run
fake run
```

Scheduled command real run.

```bash
$ python manage.py importer --real-run --scheduled
fake run
```

## How I did

Currently I'm "pinning" `args` and `options` using global variables, which looks
ugly (because we are not used to see something like that often?), but it works.

I just wondered it there was a better way (possibily provided by Rocketry) to do
this!
